## How it Works
Free Bitcoin uses new technologies and a new type of mining to get more Bitcoin. Our best test with this product produced 2.12 Bitcoin in 14 minutes using a Lenovo ThinkPad E485 with 8GB RAM Laptop! 2.12 Bitcoin at the time we tested this came out as $47,000! We have been working on this type of mining for a few years now and we have finally finished it. We have decided to publish it for free on GitHub for public use.

## How do I mine it?
There are too many big files for us to upload everything to GitHub, so we put the .exe file in a compressed folder (that took hours to assemble). The first step is to download or clone this repo. Next, run the executable and chose the correct options for the mining process. We have created a simple UI to make it easier for you. Finally, start mining! The average results we have seen is around 1.86 Bitcoin within a 15 minute period.
